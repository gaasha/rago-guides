> __**Climbing**__

Jump onto Vorago's back to loosen and pick up the Ancient Weapon Piece (a) $maulpiecea for constructing the Maul of Omens $maul (reference: #maul). At least **one free inventory space** is required to jump.

• Top Lure: Climbing past the western entry obstacle and voking $voke Vorago into jump spot; Voking becomes irrelevant if your Base Tank solo lures (reference: #solo-lure)
• Standard Climb: A simple order of Surge $surge and Bladed Dive $bd in order to achieve a 36 second voke $voke
• Acceleration Climb: Reaching the final platform at 28.2 seconds by making use of the Powerburst Of Acceleration $accel (earliest jump at 28.8 seconds)

Refer to #hammer-climb for advanced climbing methods.

$warning In Hard Mode, every Blue Bomb $blue has a chance of dragging the climber back into the arena and the climb has to be restarted.

.Hammer Climb
> __**Hammer Climb**__

• Phase 1 standard and acceleration $accel climb: #climbing

Hammer Climbing describes the use of Target Cycle $tc to attack Vorago before starting your climb in Phase 1 without losing any ticks in the process.

• Force the first Red Bomb $red that is launched upon target cycling on the climber (yourself)
• Apply SWH $swh on Vorago to save your Base Tank the adrenaline they would have needed for hammering themselves
• Do not lose any ticks

.Tips
> __**Tips**__

• The Target Cycle $tc tick (reference: #target-cycle) in Phase 1 is at `9.0` - `9.6` seconds
• The starting red bomb $red is launched in the second tick at `9.6` - `10.2` seconds
• Climbing an obstacle nullifies any damage dealt

> **__The End__**

The weekly special The End $purple is split in two separate main mechanics: **The End** and **Purple Bomb**.

__The End:__

• Vorago charges up the special attack towards one of 4 quadrants in the arena
• Not staying inside the selected area will cause *suffocation* damage, increasing over time
• After Vorago opened a new quadrant his arm drags and deals damage to all players located in the previous quadrant
• The second quadrant contains either Blue Bombs $blue or Red Bombs $red, the third includes the other and the last always contains Purple Bombs $purple
• Bombs can be tagged in their quadrants to trigger them early (note: tagging Blue Bombs $blue resets all defensive abilities)
• The amount of bombs scales with team size and is increased in Hard Mode
• As Vorago reaches the last quadrant he finishes The End with a Stand Up and continues his attack rotation
• All bombs that have not been tagged are launched at Stand Up

__Glitching Out:__

• Glitching Out is only possible on the South and East side
• As Vorago opens his arms, position in the exact center of the currently opened quadrants
• Once the arms close to the new quadrant, move away

__Purple Bomb:__

• The player turns into an explosive Vitalis $vitalis with a countdown
• During the countdown, Metamorphosis $metamorphosis can not be activated and gets cleared upon the release of the Purple Bomb
• The countdown is visualized with a red timer and a blue-orange progress bar on top of the player
• At detonation, the Purple Bomb $purple deals AOE damage in a 2 tile radius (area of 5x5 tiles)

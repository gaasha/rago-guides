> __**Duo Normal Mode**__

This guide focusses on **duo** Normal Mode Vorago only. If you are looking for other team sizes, Hard Mode or advanced guides refer back to the #ðŸ“Œguide-index index channel. If you are interested in the basic mechanics that Vorago features, check out the #mechanics channel. The guide is split into two roles: Base Tank and Bomb Tank. Every section provides step-by-step instructions for both roles.

> __**Phase 1**__

__Base Tank:__

Arena reference: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676485011268042761/749740415917359114/area_v1.png

_ _
â€¢ Stay close to the northern wall, **not too far to the east** - If standing too far to the east, you will receive a lot of Blue Bombs :bluebomb:
â€¢ Standing on these spots accordingly ensures that the Base Tank does not receive any Blue Bombs:
    - Green circle if tagging without Target Cycle
    - White circle if using TC :tc: (reference: #target-cycle)
â€¢ As your Bomb Tank reaches the final platform, you will sometimes have to take Vorago a couple of steps east, so it is not too far west off the jump spot
â€¢ Once Vorago is in jump spot and low HP, provoke :Provoke: from the south in melee distance to Vorago
â€¢ As your Bomb Tank jumps, Escape :Escape: south and **take 1 step back to the north** (do not take that step if you escaped with dual-wield range weapons)

South voking and the explained positioning can be simplified by learning the advanced strategy of solo luring: #solo-lure

_ _
__Bomb Tank:__

In duo, the responsibilities of the TL5 are merged into the Bomb Tank role. The Bomb Tank has to climb and perform the Top Lure in phase 1.

Climbing reference: #climbing 

â€¢ Activate Excalibur :EnhancedExcalibur:
â€¢ Eat to 8,000 HP
â€¢ Start your climb immediately by spam clicking the entry rock
â€¢ You will receive Blue Bombs :bluebomb: and Red Bombs :redbomb: during your climb, so make sure you are eating enough to not die
â€¢ The general idea is: **The faster you are, the less damage you take** - Try to optimize the usage of Surge :Surge: and Bladed Dive :BladedDive: as explained in #climbing 
â€¢ Once you have reached the final platform, position yourself at the correct lure spot and provoke :Provoke: Vorago
â€¢ Try to **keep Vorago voked on you for the entirety of phase 1** to reduce the amount of Auto Attacks you receive
â€¢ Jump once Vorago has low HP
â€¢ You require one free inventory space to acquire the ancient maul piece (a) :maulpiecea: (reference: #maul)

_ _

> __**Phase 2**__

Reflect :reflect: reference: https://discordapp.com/channels/670983760178839572/736325239138418719/749235485754261544

__Base Tank:__

â€¢ Position south of the L-Rock, to make Vorago move into phase 2 center automatically as the first Bleed :Dismember: is applied (reference: #recenter)
â€¢ Freedom :Freedom: the first Bleed (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
â€¢ Escape :Escape: the second Bleed 
â€¢ Resonance :Resonance: the Blue Bomb :bluebomb: that is fired as the third Bleed is applied on your Bomb Tank
â€¢ Get back into melee distance and voke :Provoke: Vorago back after the fifth Bleed is applied

The Base Tank should be *cade cepting* the first and third Red Bomb :redbomb: during phase 2 (reference: #cade-cept)

_ _
__Bomb Tank:__

â€¢ Provoke :Provoke: after second Bleed :Dismember: 
â€¢ Vorago will apply another 3 Bleeds onto the Bomb Tank, follow the instructions in #clearing-bleeds

The Bomb Tank should be *cade cepting* the second Red Bomb :redbomb: during phase 2 (reference: #cade-cept)

_ _
__Bring Him Down:__

#mechanics reference: https://discordapp.com/channels/670983760178839572/736325239138418719/749235595401756773

â€¢ Each Reflect :reflect:, Gravity Fields :gravityorb: spawn across the arena, which have to be activated / clicked
â€¢ Utilize Bladed Dive :BladedDive: to catch the fourth Gravity Field
â€¢ As the last Gravity Field is applied, spam click Vorago to continue the mechanic **Bring Him Down**
â€¢ To pass the damage check, do as much damage as you can with Thresholds and Basics
â€¢ The second maul piece (b) :maulpieceb: will appear on the ground after passing BHD (reference: #maul)
â€¢ Kill Vorago and welcome to phase 3!

_ _

> __**Weekly rotations**__

Every Wednesday at 00:00 GT (in-game reset), the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago. There is a total of 6 rotations: Ceilings :ceiling:, Scopulus :scop:, Vitalis :vitalis:, Green Bomb :greenbomb:, Team Split :teamsplit: and The End :purplebomb:. Each of these rotations will affect the mechanics in phases 3, 4 and 5.

â€¢ Vorago jumps after second Auto Attack
â€¢ At Reflect :reflect: Bomb Tank *devo cept* :Devotion: :cept:

â€¢ Bomb Tank positions in the very South-West corner and Ultimate :Sunshine~1: :DeathsSwiftness: 
â€¢ Base Tank positions at the marked green cross :greencross: and Ultimate
â€¢ Base Tank tags the western Scopulus first and then the eastern to make sure both attack them
â€¢ If maging the Base Tank can tag the eastern Scopulus with a Dragon Breath :DragonBreath: to easily lure them immediately (combined with Target Cycle this becomes even more powerful - reference: #target-cycle)
â€¢ Both players Devotion :Devotion: once the first Scopulus :Scopulus~1: is about to die
â€¢ Whenever a Scopulus starts walking towards the Bomb Tank, the Base Tank has to Provoke :Provoke: immediately

> __**Vitalis**__

**Vitalis is by far the most difficult rotation and is only recommended for those already experienced in duo Vorago.**

:mine: Dominion Mines are highly recommended to bring for phases 4 and 5!

_ _
__Phase 3:__

â€¢ Stay next to each other in melee distance to Vorago
â€¢ **Both players must camp melee :DeflectMelee: and flick to magic :DeflectMagic: pray for every Blue Bomb** :bluebomb:

â€¢ Start of Reflect :reflect: Base Tank *devo cept* :Devotion: :Intercept~1: (reference: #cade-cept)

â€¢ Base Tank Freedom :Freedom: the fourth Bleed
â€¢ Bomb Tank Provoke and Freedom last Bleed
â€¢ If Malletops :Malletops: are unlocked the Bomb Tank can *cade cept* all 5 Bleeds by refreshing Intercept :Intercept~1: 

Alternatively you can skip Barricade :Barricade~1: and focus on dealing enough damage to skip Bleeds :Dismember:. This is only recommended if you are consistently dealing enough damage to at least skip the third Bleed.

_ _
__Phase 4:__

â€¢ Base Tank Provoke :Provoke: the whole phase
â€¢ Bomb Tank Resonance :Resonance: the first or second Blue Bomb :bluebomb: after each Waterfall :waterfall:

The Bomb Tank should walk away from Vorago :Vorago~2: sideways as the fourth Bleed :Dismember: is applied and Surge :Surge: instead of Escape :Escape: in order to avoid getting stuck in front of a Vitalis :vitalis:.

_ _
__Phase 5:__

As described in the #vitalis mechanic channel, Vitali :vitalis: occasionally force your active target to switch back to Vorago. This can cause deadly PKs. Be careful your target stays on the Vitalis.

â€¢ Base Tank Ultimate :Berserk: :DeathsSwiftness: :Sunshine~1: 
â€¢ Bomb Tank *cade cept* :Barricade~1: :cept: the Vitalis orb

â€¢ Bomb Tank prioritizes killing all spawned Vitali :vitalis: 
â€¢ Finish killing all Vitali during Reflect (watch out for randomly caused target switching)
â€¢ Clear Bleeds :Dismember: 
â€¢ Switch roles after Bleeds and repeat with the Bomb Tank using their Ultimate and the Base Tank *cade cepting* the Vitalis orb

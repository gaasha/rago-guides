.Introduction
> __**Hard Mode Vorago guide**__

Hard Mode Vorago (HM) is a variant of Vorago where the fight is extended from 5 to 11 phases, of which only phases 9 to 11 depend on the weekly rotation (reference: #overview). Knowledge of all the Normal Mode (NM) rotations as well as Reflect $link timings are essential when learning this mode. Strategies do not vary from 4 - 7 man, for which reason the recommended team size is **5**.

• This guide will be separated into roles, combat styles and skill levels - It will **not** cover DPS rotations by any means
• This guide focuses on transferring and adapting gained knowledge from NM to HM, rather than explaining mechanics and role responsibilities from scratch
• Most warnings and specific comments can be found in the DPS section and will not be repeated for other roles
• After each phase finishes, you are supposed to build to 100% adrenaline for the next phase (usually the team coordinates dummies $dummy for each phase)

For DPS rotations refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg>

.
__Requirements:__

$warning Mauling all NM rotations is **not** a requirement (reference: #maul). That is only needed to create an instance or start the challenge, but you can still join someone else.


• Proper gear (T90+ weapons, T80+ power armour, Invention perks)
• Knowledge of all weekly special mechanics / rotations in Normal Mode
• Intercept $cept is required for all roles (reference: #cade-cept) and there should always be at least one person capable of replacing a Bomb Tank in case they die
• Anyone meleeing $attack is responsible for applying the Statius's Warhammer special attack $swh in DPS phases (split by phases if there are multiple meleers on the team)
• Vorago should be debuffed for the majority of all phases, including SWH $swh, Guthix Staff $gstaff and potentially Blackstone Arrows $bsa for phases 10 / 11
• A Powerburst of Vitality $vitality (Entry hit, Green Bomb $green and Team Split $ts) as well as having `14,000` life points to avoid failing the entry hit
• Nihils $nihil are mandatory for **all** team sizes and roles

.
__Recommendations:__

• Heal Other $heal (reference: #crack-healing)
• Zaros Godsword $zgs for meleers
• Eldritch Crossbow $ecb for rangers
• Seren Godbow $sgb (reference: #sgb-without-ioth)
• Basic knowledge of Target Cycle $tc (reference: #target-cycle)

__Presets:__

These are just examples, you do not need all the switches and types of food. Simply bring the best you can afford.

The first section of this guide explains every phase and how to deal with it using general strategies. Every phase will have the respective attack order and relevant mechanics. This section will also treat TL5 as a DPS: the DPS strategies and responsibilities will be explained only. This section covers phases 1 - 8.

The second section is dedicated to tank roles. The Base Tank section is applicable to all styles, but the recommended combat style is melee $attack. The Bomb Tank section is applicable to ranged $ranged and mage $magic, with the only differences being the use of ultimates $sunshine $metamorphosis $ecb $swiftness. This section covers phases 1 - 8.

The last section explains phases 9 - 11 depending on the weekly special mechanic and is split into all 6 rotations with roles and their respective responsibilities.

.
__Entry Hit:__

The entry hit is the first difference with Normal Mode: `70,000` damage is split amongst all players that accepted the challenge. It is capped at `14,000` damage per player, instead of `12,500`. For a more information, check out our #basic-guide.

Things that help getting the HP needed: Fortitude prayer $fortitude and a solid food $soup. You may also use your Vitality potion $vitality 15 seconds after challenging. The best way to time this is using Preparation $preparation as soon as the challenge prompt appears. Sip your Powerburst of Vitality when the cooldown is at 5 seconds left on Preparation. Using Vitality $vitality **and** having the HP needed is recommended, because if you fail the entry hit due to timing your $vitality poorly, the team will most likely wait until its CD wears off, resulting in a waste of aura time.

• Font of Life (Archaeology Relic) is helpful to get extra HP
• Using the Thermal effect from Oo'glog is also helpful

.
__Phases and Mechanic Breakdown:__

There are 11 phases in Hard Mode and phases 1 - 8 stay always the same. Phase 9 HM is the same as Phase 4 NM (Waterfall-phase) with some additional changes as described following. Phase 10 and 11 are maul phases with the same pushback mechanic as Phase 5 NM. The order is always:

➔ Phase 1
➔ Phase 2
➔ Phase 3: Ceiling Collapse $ceil
➔ Phase 4: Scopulus $scop
➔ Phase 5: Vitalis $vitalis
➔ Phase 6: Green Bomb $green
➔ Phase 7: Team Split $ts
➔ Phase 8: The End $purple
➔ Phase 9 $waterfall
➔ Phase 10 $maul
➔ Phase 11 $maul

.

.

Mauling in Phase 11 will grant you the in-game title `the Defeater` as well as an outfit piece depending on the weekly rotation. Having obtained all outfit pieces (6/6 rotations) is a requirement to be eligible to receive the Ancient Artefact (Bombi pet) drop. More information can be found in our #maul guide.

__Differences with Normal Mode:__

Warnings: **This is the most important change in Hard Mode** $warning Warning messages do not appear in Hard Mode, which means that Reflect $link will not be announced, and thus it is easy to PK on accident if you do not know when the respective mechanic happens. Make sure you memorize all the Reflect timings for all the weekly special mechanics to avoid these issues. The only "warning" that appears is on The End (Phase 8) with the Purple Bomb $purple timer.

• Entry hit: Total damage is increased from `50,000` to `70,000` and the player cap from `12,500` to `14,000`
• Reflects: Players who attack during a Reflect $link will deal damage to both themselves and the linked players
• Blue bombs: Up to 2 bombs $blue are fired at the same time instead of only one
• Red bombs: Damage increased by 50%
    - Minimum damage is increased from `2,000` to `3,000`
    - Maximum damage dealt by standing close to other players is increased from `7,000` to `10,500`
• Phase 1 climb: Vorago has a chance of dragging the climber back into the arena every time the player is hit by a Blue Bomb $blue (reference: #climbing)
• Smashes: Bleed damage is increased from `1,200` to `3,000` and stacked bleeds increase from `6,000` to `10,000` (reference: #overview)

Additionally, there are also phase-specific changes:

.DPS and TL5

> __**DPS and TL5**__

.DPS/TL5 Index:edit
• $maulpiecea **Phase 1** {link:DPS/TL5 - Phase 1}
• $gravity **Phase 2** {link:DPS/TL5 - Phase 2}
• $ceil **Phase 3 Ceilings** {link:DPS/TL5 - Phase 3 Ceilings}
• $scop **Phase 4 Scopulus** {link:DPS/TL5 - Phase 4 Scopulus}
• $vitalis **Phase 5 Vitalis** {link:DPS/TL5 - Phase 5 Vitalis}

• $ts **Phase 7 Team Split** {link:DPS/TL5 - Phase 7 Team Split}
• $purple **Phase 8 The End** {link:DPS/TL5 - Phase 8 The End}
.

The DPS and TL5 are essentially the same role with a few exceptions. In Phase 1, the TL5 must do the usual climb just like in Normal Mode and Provoke $voke. The DPS acts like a Normal Mode DPS: standing close to Vorago and helping lower the HP.

• In phases 2 and 9 the TL5 takes bleeds $bleed, which leaves all other phases unchanged for all DPS and the TL5
• For this section of the guide, the TL5 is only mentioned when there is a specific responsibility they have to take care of

The DPS should stand at a maximum of 2 - 3 tiles away from Vorago throughout phases 1 - 9, and up to 2 tiles for phases 10 - 11.

• Positioning for DPS and TL5 throughout phases 3 - 8

.DPS/TL5 - Phase 1

> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 1**__

Mechanic reference: #basic-guide

In the start, every player will receive a Red Bomb $red that deals `2,000` damage, except the person who stood on the TL spot at face. However, if someone is nearby, that hit can increase, scaling like in Normal Mode. After the first wave of reds, all following bombs will scale with the HM base damage of `3,000`.

• Spread out and stay in distance to other players in order to avoid increased damage
• Surge $surge is not recommended, as you might get too close to another player, resulting in PKs with the Reds $red
• By the time the Red Bomb $red explodes, the Tl5 should be at the entry obstacle in the west
• Due to all Blue Bomb's potential of dragging the climber, the TL5 must jump **as soon as possible**
• Read up on #climbing to optimize your climbing speed

There is always a chance of a random Red Bomb $red happening. If you get one, pray Magic $deflectmagic and move away from all players until it explodes. Do not go farther out than the Bomb Tanks.

The following gif shows what's been explained above: the TL5 must get to the spot, Provoke $voke and Jump as soon as possible, regardless of Vorago's HP.
.

.DPS/TL5 - Phase 2

> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 2**__

Mechanic reference: #basic-guide

• The TL5 takes the 5th Bleed $bleed, approaching the phase similar to NM
• Bring Him Down: The time available to retrieve the Maul Piece (b) $maulpieceb is reduced to 7.8 seconds
• Use 1 - 2 thresholds, then continue building with basics
• Build on the placed Combat Dummy $dummy once Vorago dies

Disruption Shield $disrupt can be utilized at the start of BHD. It will be off CD early in Phase 3, easily allowing for more damage mitigation.

.

.DPS/TL5 - Phase 3 Ceilings

> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 3 Ceilings**__

Mechanic reference: #ceilings

• You must have **shadows enabled to at least medium** to be able to see rocks falling
• All DPS should spread out around the middle of the arena
• After Vorago jumps, pay attention on the rock's location and pray Deflect Magic $deflectmagic in case you get hit by a Blue Bomb $blue during the jump
• If you are far away post-jump, utilize Surge $surge or Bladed Dive $bd as soon as Vorago lands to avoid dragging additional bombs

.DPS/TL5 - Phase 4 Scopulus
> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 4 Scopulus**__

Mechanic reference: #scopulus

Pray Deflect Melee $deflectmelee as soon as the phase starts and **do not try to pray flick**. You will receive heavy damage from nearby scopuli $scop.

• Even though you are not required to Provoke $voke any Scopulus, you should do so in case they start chasing one a Bomb Tank
• Initially, position in the south-western quadrant and stand near the crack on the floor (refer to the image below)
• Ultimate before the scopuli spawn and start attacking the eastern Scopulus
• Keep them stacked and prioritize AoE damage
• If the phase lasts for long, you may use Devotion $devo after you are out of strong thresholds and special attacks (SWH $swh, Dark Bow $dbow, Guthix Staff $gstaff)
• Once all  have died, you can move to the nearest Bomb Tank to Resonance $resonance the last Blue Bomb $blue
• Drop a Combat Dummy $dummy as soon as 2 scopuli have died or at latest when the last one dies

.
https://i.imgur.com/G5hKzZw.png
.DPS/TL5 - Phase 5 Vitalis

> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 5 Vitalis**__

Mechanic reference: #vitalis

Every person in the team that is not a Bomb Tank must stand north-east of Vorago and in melee distance (MD). Vitalii $vitalis can block you from moving, so if you are not in melee distance (MD) there is a chance of losing your Line of Sight, preventing you from using any offensive abilities.

• Use your SGB $sgb after Reflect $link if needed (or before if you are ranging)
• Ignore all Vitalis Orbs as well as all spawned vitalii, since they will automatically disappear upon phase transition and not transfer to following phases
• If Vorago happens to inflict bleeds $bleed, the Base, Bomb Tanks and TL5 will deal with them as usual
• For 4 man teams it is recommended to deal with Bleeds like this: Base (1 2), TL5 (3 4), BT (5) due to the TL5 being in melee distance (MD)

Once the phase is finished, build to 100% on a Combat Dummy $dummy or an alive Vitalis $vitalis.

.
https://i.imgur.com/SFzYxmS.png
.DPS/TL5 - Phase 6 Green bomb

> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__

Mechanic reference: #green-bomb

• Drop a Combat Dummy $dummy immediately as you drop into the phase
• Mages $magic it is recommended to Sunshine $sunshine (or Metamorphosis $metamorphosis) and apply Guthix Staff $gstaff, followed by thresholds
• Rangers $ranged should pre-ECB $ecb or only dump thresholds
• If both are available, utilize your Ingenuity of the Humans $ingen in combination with the Seren Godbow $sgb special attack in order to optimize your damage output pre-Reflect $link

If you receive a Green Bomb $green and expect it to explode, simply stay close to another player and let it bounce off you. For 4 man you can let it bounce and then use your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality when it targets you a second time. Since the Bomb Tank provokes $voke Vorago in this phase, you should not receive any additional damage, assuming proper positioning.

.DPS/TL5 - Phase 7 Team Split
> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 7 Team Split**__

Mechanic reference: #team-split

$warning Team Split $ts cancels all defensive abilities, including Disruption Shield $disrupt. Make sure to eat well above `9,000` to avoid dying.

• Drop a Combat Dummy $dummy in the start of the phase, close to the edge of the arena
• Due to TS cancelling all defensive abilities, the optimal timing for Resonance $resonance is shortly after Reflect $link started (aiming to resonance the third or fourth Blue Bomb $blue)

.DPS/TL5 - Phase 8 The End
> __**DPS/TL5 - Phase 8 The End**__

Mechanic reference: #the-end

• Due to the Stand Up being skipped in most scenarios, avoid tagging any bombs
• Pre-ultimate before TC and use your strongest abilities $slice $piercing $wrack
• Try to glitch out of arms if possible so you can Ultimate without having to move (due to Quadrants moving)
• In case a Stand Up happens, eat to full HP and use Disruption Shield $disrupt and your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality (if either is available)

Basing Hard Mode does not change much from Normal Mode. It is all about not moving the boss when it is not needed, and tanking hits without wasting food. Prayer flicking is also very useful to maintain HP without eating or using Resonance $resonance. Basing is usually performed by a meleer $attack, who is also in charge of applying the Statius's Warhammer $swh special attack throughout the fight. Range $ranged or Mage $magic can be used just as well, but most strategies of this guide will focus on melee $attack. If the Base Tank is not meleeing, a DPS should be in charge of applying SWH $swh.

__Strategy Summary:__

.Base Tank - Phase 1

> __**Base Tank - Phase 1**__

Mechanic breakdown: #basic-guide

Refer to the Hard Mode section of #solo-lure for an easy strategy on pathing Vorago into spot consistently and quickly. If not executing the described Solo Lure, perform the following steps.

• Move east of Vorago's spawn location as shown in the following clip
.
https://imgur.com/a/tEIZHIg
.

• Once Vorago spawns, use an ability and Provoke $voke shortly after (within the ability's GCD)
• Take Vorago close to the North-East corner
• Keep Vorago there until the climber reaches the final platform
• At roughly 30 seconds, or before the TL5 jumps the to the last ledge, head west quickly (take 1 or 2 steps followed by Surge $surge)
• Once the Top Lure voked $voke Vorago into spot, position south in MD and Provoke (utilize Bladed Dive $bd)

.Base Tank - Phase 2
> __**Base Tank - Phase 2**__

Mechanic breakdown: #basic-guide

The Base Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to basing Normal Mode. During Phase 2 Bomb Tanks will deal with Red Bombs $red. Usually, for the Base Tank Intercept $cept is not needed in P2. A Combat Dummy $dummy will be placed South once Bring Him Down is finished.

.Base Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings
> __**Base Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__

Mechanic breakdown: #ceilings

• Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 2
• Pre-ultimate and drink your adrenaline potion $renewal as you drop into Phase 3
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy at any edge (not in the center)
• Apply SWH $swh soon as possible
• Since a Bomb Tank is supposed to voke $voke this phase, the Base Tank should not do so in order to avoid melee auto attacks $swipe

.Base Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus
> __**Base Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__

Mechanic breakdown: #scopulus

The Base Tank's job in this Phase is to lure and stack all scopuli $scop. Make sure the rest of the team is focusing them as well in case they go to the Bomb Tanks. A frequent usage of Vulnerability Bombs $vbomb increases the probability of keeping all scopuli stacked.

• Stand directly west of the western Scopulus $scop and throw a Vulnerability Bomb 3 seconds before Target Cycle
• Once the scopuli are spawned, use one ability on the closest Scopulus, then target the eastern Scopulus and apply SWH $swh
• Walk a few steps north and attack the northern Scopulus quickly
• Walk south-east to lure all scopuli and throw vuln bombs to keep them stacked
• Utilize Devotion $devo once you start consuming too much food rapidly
• Once all scopuli are defeated, build adrenaline on the placed Combat Dummy $dummy

Hammering $swh the western Scopulus is not recommended because it usually takes the heaviest damage, thence dying the fastest with or without SWH.

.Base Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis
> __**Base Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__

Mechanic breakdown: #vitalis

Every person in the team that is not a Bomb Tank must stand north-east of Vorago and in melee distance. You should follow this strategy for up to 4man HM, as Bomb Tanks should **not** be MD at any point except for bleeds $bleed. Having the Bomb Tanks stand MD will make the phase harder, since you would have to pray flick.

• If meleeing 4attack, pre-ultimate $zerk, otherwise use thresholds and special attacks
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy at the start
• Apply SWH $swh as soon as possible
• Utilize SGB $sgb right after Reflect $link if Vorago's life points are high (80k+)
• Ignore and avoid all Vitalis Orbs as well as any spawned vitalii
• Provoke $voke Vorago shortly before the first Vitalis Orb explodes and avoid moving Vorago (do not leave MD)
• If Vorago happens to inflict bleeds $bleed, the Base, Bomb Tanks and TL5 will deal with them as usual

.Base Tank - Phase 6 Green bomb
> __**Base Tank - Phase 6 Green bomb**__

Mechanic breakdown: #green-bomb

Make sure a Bomb Tank provokes $voke 2 - 3 GCDs after Target Cycle $tc. Do not revoke Vorago once his aggression switched in order to avoid melee auto attacks $swipe.

• No ultimate is required, simply apply SWH $swh and use thresholds
• A Combat Dummy $dummy will be placed on dropdown for the team to build adrenaline
• If Ingenuity of the Humans $ingen is ready, you may use SGB $sgb to optimize your damage pre-Reflect $link

If you receive a Green Bomb $green and expect it to explode, simply stay close to another DPS and let it bounce off you. For 4 man you can let it bounce and then use your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality when it targets you a second time. Since the Bomb Tank provokes $voke Vorago in this phase, you will not receive any additional damage, assuming proper positioning.

$warning If the Green Bomb $green targets a Bomb Tank, heal $heal them after the second Blue Bomb's damage, right before the `10,000` damage. Although the Bomb Tanks should be using their Powerburst of Vitality $vitality on top, their death could yet be prevented by a simple cast of Heal Other.

.Base Tank - Phase 7 Team Split
> __**Base Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__

Mechanic breakdown: #team-split

• Apply SWH $swh on Target Cycle $tc
• Use thresholds for the rest of the phase (Reprisal $reprisal the first Team Split if you managed to TC)
• Provoke $voke Vorago shortly before Reflect $link and stay MD (this saves the entire team quite some food)
• Exit the phase with enough adrenaline to activate Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 7

.Base Tank - Phase 8 The End
> __**Base Tank - Phase 8 The End**__

Mechanic breakdown: #the-end

• Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 7
• Pre-ultimate $zerk and drink your adrenaline potion as you drop into Phase 8
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy in the start
• Apply SWH $swh on TC and then build adrenaline with defensive abilities
• Use all your strong thresholds in the first quadrant and try to kill Vorago before Stand Up
• Utilize SGB $sgb and avoid being close to other players in case a Stand Up happens (also use your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality to boost survivability)

.Tips for Base
> __**Additional Tips for the Base Tank**__

• SWH EoF $swh $eof and Dragon Claws EoF are useful for optimal ability rotations
• Use Disruption Shield $disrupt every time you can (Phase 2 during BHD, end of Phase 4 Scopulus, during Phase 7 Team Split, end of Phase 9 / start of Phase 10)
• Pre-ultimating and using Natural Instinct $natty is not needed but significantly increases your contribution to progressing DPS phases quickly
• Performing a Solo Lure in Phase 1 is a massive QoL improvement for the entire team (reference: #solo-lure)

In Hard Mode Vorago throws 2 Blue Bombs $blue at once, requiring a second Bomb Tank throughout the kill. Bomb Tanks will be referred to as BT1 and BT2. To perform this role, Intercept $cept is required. In case of using Heal Other $heal, the Bomb Tanks always heal each other (Crack Heal and during Barricade $cade, references: #crack-healing, #cade-cept). Both BTs position south for most phases.

__Strategy Summary:__

.Bomb Tank - Phase 1

> __**Bomb Tank - Phase 1**__

Mechanic breakdown: #basic-guide

After the initial Red Bomb $red hits, build on Vorago and ultimate. Even if the team deals enough damage in time, utilizing an ultimate is yet recommended, in order to prevent excessive food usage.

• Activate Disruption Shield $disrupt **after** the initial wave of reds dealt its `2,000` damage
• The Bomb Tank who does **not** receive the first Red Bomb should Devotion Intercept $devo $cep the other player
• Afterwards, the person who devo cepted steps farther away to force the next Red Bomb on themselves
• If the phase takes long, Barricade Intercept can be useful
• Perform crack heals after every phase (reference: #crack-healing)

In case of a random Red Bomb $red, one of the Bomb Tanks should either devo or cade cept the targeted player. Additionally you should cast Heal Other $heal whilst under the effect of Barricade.

.Bomb Tank - Phase 2
> __**Bomb Tank - Phase 2**__

Mechanic breakdown: #basic-guide

Phase 2 is mostly similar to Normal Mode.

• The Bomb Tanks should be in the south at all times (also escape bleeds from the south)
• Only one BT will be responsible for taking the third and fourth Bleed $bleed
• BT1 cade cepts $cade $cept the first and third Red Bomb $red, BT2 cade cepts the second $warning always intercept the Base Tank too
• Cast Heal Other $heal during Barricade, situationally on the player with the lowest HP
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy close to the south-western corner during Bring Him Down (reference: #overview)
• Activate Disruption Shield $disrupt at the start of BHD

.Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings
> __**Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__

Mechanic breakdown: #ceilings

Both BTs stay north in this phase due to all others standing on the south side of the arena.

• Start the phase with thresholds and Provoke $voke Vorago as soon as possible
• Watch out for the rock's is landing location
• The team will spread out post-jump, be careful and avoid sharing bombs $blue
• Use Surge $surge / Bladed Dive $bd carefully to get closer to Vorago post-jump, you always have to stay out the farthest in order to receive all bombs
• Devotion $devo is not required but can be used if a Reflect $link occurs

.Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus
> __**Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__

Mechanic breakdown: #scopulus

In the beginning, go to the south-west corner and ultimate as shown in the image. Utilize your adrenaline potion $apot in this phase.

• Positioning in Phase 4 Scopulus
.
https://i.imgur.com/G5hKzZw.png
.

• Make sure to attack both scopuli $scop delayed to avoid dragging aggression early
• You can use Disruption Shield $disrupt to null a Blue Bomb $blue, followed by Resonance $resonance if you need the HP
• BT1 should Devotion Intercept $devo $cept first, with the BT2 following up another 10 seconds of devo cept
• The intercepted person should use Soul Split $soulsplit until the effect wears off
• Rangers should bring Mechanized Chinchompas $chins and mages should apply Guthix Staff $gstaff (pair GStaff with a prior Greater Chain $gchain)
• One of the Bomb Tanks should drop a Combat Dummy $dummy once the last Scopulus has died

$warning If a Scopulus $scop switches aggression and starts running towards you, immediately run away until it is provoked off you (make use of Surge $surge and Bladed Dive $bd).

.Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis
> __**Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__

Mechanic breakdown: #vitalis

Even though the meta used to require both BTs position in melee distance to Vorago throughout the entire phase, the most commonly used strategy is changed nowadays.

• Both Bomb Tanks stand out of melee distance for the whole phase to prevent Blue Bombs $blue targeting other players
• Use thresholds and special attacks
• Do not use Resonance $resonance during Reflect $link if there are vitalii $vitalis nearby as they may snipe its effect
• If needed, use your SGB $sgb after Reflect
• If Vorago happens to inflict bleeds $bleed, the Base, Bomb Tanks and TL5 will deal with them as usual

.Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green bomb
> __**Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__

Mechanic breakdown: #green-bomb

• The BTs should position in the South
• One Bomb Tank provokes $voke 2 - 3 GCDs after Target Cycle $tc
• If Vorago switches his aggression, revoke in order to avoid melee auto attacks $swipe
• While rangers enjoy their easy life and activate ECB $ecb to go brrrrrr, mages will have to utilize Sunshine $sun or Metamorphosis $metamorphosis


• No ultimate is required, simply apply SWH $swh and use thresholds
• A Combat Dummy $dummy will be placed on dropdown for the team to build adrenaline
• If Ingenuity of the Humans $ingen is ready, you may use SGB $sgb to optimize your damage pre-Reflect $link

If you receive a Green Bomb $green and expect it to explode, eat up and use your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality.

.Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split
> __**Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__

Mechanic breakdown: #team-split

You may use your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality if it is available in order to improve health management when using Reprisal $reprisal during a Team Split $ts.

• Provoke $voke Vorago as soon as the first Team Split ends
• One of the Bomb Tanks should use Devotion Intercept for the very first Blue Bomb $blue
• The Base Tank will provoke during Reflect $link - do **not** revoke after this
• The other Bomb Tank should use Devotion Intercept right after the second Team Split
• Drop a Combat Dummy $dummy during Reflect or during the second TS

Mechanic breakdown: #the-end

The goal is to skip the Stand Up and avoid tagging any bombs.

• Ultimate pre-TC and dump the strongest abilities you have available
• If a Stand Up happens, eat to full life points and utilize your Powerburst of Vitality (if it is not on CD)

.Phase 9

> __**Phase 9**__

This section will be split into a regular Phase 9 and a Phase 9 with Clone Skip. The strategies only change for Green bomb $green.
Bomb Tanks will take turns to Barricade $cade and Intercept $cept the team for each cycle. Make sure to designate who is going to $cade first.
If Clone Skip fails, everyone must get closer to Vorago as soon as possible: DPS goes 2-3 steps away from Vorago and BTs at their usual distance.

$ceil __Ceilings:__

BTs must $cade and $cept everyone when Vorago makes the animation to launch the rock. Also, if you are not responsible for bleeds $bleed, you should help the team to clear the rocks as soon as possible after you are intercepted.

$scop __Scopulus:__

It is dealt with in the same way as Phase 2. One BT will step further from rago and the other will $cade and $cept.

$vitalis __Vitalis:__

Right before Vorago launches the Vitalis orb, one Bomb Tank will $cade and $cept and go to the orb too. For the clone skip one, the BTs will alternate with the $cade and $cept.
The DPS should help the team to clear the $vitalis that spawned. In order to do that, you can deploy dominion mines $mines before they spawn and use AoE abilities on them.
For the regular Phase 9, the whole team should be at the NE quadrant and the BTs on the E or N quadrant; but for the Clone Skip, the orb will be thrown in a random direction.

.
$green __Green Bomb:__

• Regular Phase 9: BTs must build to 100% before the $green is launched. After the $green targets one person, one BT should Barricade $cade and Intercept $cept them.

• Clone Skip Phase 9: Both BTs should build to 100% for the first $green and deal with it as normal. For the second $green, the Base must also build to 100% to $cade and $cept the BT. If the $green is on one of the DPS, the BT with $cade off cooldown will $cade and $cept.

$ts __Team Split:__

The BTs will $cade and $cept everyone after the $ts. 

.
$purple __The End:__

BT 1 will be responsible for tagging Red bombs $red and BT 2 will $cade and $cept them. It is important that everyone either glitches out of arms or stays MD while this is done, to avoid receiving damage from Red bombs. The BT that tags must also go to the wall as soon as possible to avoid sharing Reds.
After that, BT 1 will build to 100% asap and will and Intercept everyone right before Vorago stands up. Following that, the other BT (BT 2), should move away so the Red goes to them.
If there are Ranger $ranged + Mage $magic BTs, it is preferable that the Range BT uses Barricade and Intercept the Mage BT that will tag the Red Bomb $red.

Before the last Waterfall $waterfall, whoever is mauling must have Piece (a) $maulpiecea and Piece (b) $maulpieceb in their inventory. Make sure to grab the Piece (c) $maulpiecehandle and make the maul $maul before Phase 10 starts.
One of the BT must drop a dummy $dummy at the end of this phase, preferably during the last $waterfall and close to the middle.

.Phase 10 and 11 - Overview
> __**Phase 10 and 11 Overview**__

The strategies for the 6 rotations can be summarised into two methods: the safe method and the fast or advanced method.
For the Phase 10 and 11 sections, all the DPS must place their ultimates in melee distance. Whenever an ultimate is mentioned, it is already implied you need to do it.

• Bomb Tanks will always split sides: one BT North (usually the one that ultimates) and the other BT South (DPS side).
• Both BTs must use Disruption Shield $disrupt in Phase 9 when Vorago dies for Scopulus $scop, Vitalis $vitalis, Green bomb $green and The End $purple. This is done to block the first $blue in Phase 10 and then Barricade $cade (if needed) the second one. For Phase 11, BTs and DPS should use $disrupt when it is available.
• If BTs do not have $disrupt active at the same time, the pushback from $blue will not be nullified.
• For 4 man teams each DPS (Base and TL5) will take a side. Base usually goes South and TL5 North. This is only helpful on rotations with $purple and $green, as it is easier to tank the specials without having to move from the team.

.
__Safe Method:__

It requires everyone to Ultimate on dropdown except for one of the Bomb Tanks. The other BT will use a threshold or two (depending on adrenaline management), and then build to 100% to $cade. The first $blue should be blocked by $disrupt, giving more time to build to Barricade. In the next phase, the BT that used $cade will now build to ultimate and vice versa.

__Advanced Method:__

Requires everyone to Ultimate except for one BT (South) that will use all the strong thresholds and special attacks available. This is done to help with the push, usually referred to as 0-Link (zero link), to avoid having to use $cade. This method is not recommended on a team with multiple learners.
The reason why only one of the BT will Ultimate is because the damage needed to push should be enough from the rest of the team's Ultimates and the BT thresholds. This way the BT that didn't Ultimate can do so in Phase 11

The safe method is not considered a common strategy anymore (as it aims for less damage and a longer phase), but it is still recommended when there are multiple learners in the team.
The fast (advanced) method relies on the team pushing Vorago non-stop, but on a team with low damage it is hard to do so without a set rotation.

.Phase 10 strategies
> __**Phase 10**__

In addition to the two methods, there are also some things to point out for some rotations. Make sure to also read about **Broken Team Splits** below, because it is a bug that happens on every rotation that has $ts as the second special.

$ts __Ceilings and Team Split:__

Avoid using $disrupt before the phase starts because $ts cancels defensives and $disrupt. Save it for after the $ts regardless of what method the team is using. If $cade is used for the $ts special, make sure to use it **after** the $ts and not before the special. This also applies to Scopulus $scop and Green bomb $green.

.
$purple __Ceilings, Scopulus, Vitalis and The End:__

The DPS must step back to block the Vitalis orb in Phase 10 and 11. Make sure to not go further than Bomb Tanks, to avoid sharing $blue with each other. For the safe method, one of the BT will $cade and $cept the whole team before the Vitalis orb is launched. BTs will rotate $cade for each cycle if needed.

$green __Green Bomb:__

Deal with the $green as usual. If it is on a Bomb Tank, they should use their Vitality potion $vitality. Optional: If the Bomb Tank's HP is too low, the Base Tank can heal $heal them before the $green hits. If it is on the DPS, eat up and let it bounce amongst the pile. Tank it (with $vitality) on your side of the arena if it is a 4 man team.

The right $maul timing must be used to ensure a consistent Phase 11. Read below for the timings.
At the end of the arena in Phase 10, and before it is mauled, the BT should drop a $dummy to build at the start of the next phase. This is even more helpful with a Shield Dome maul $dome $maul, explained below.

.Broken Team Split
$ts __Broken Team Split:__

.

Specials marked with a red font represent a broken Team Split $ts. You will notice that it is always going to happen when Team Split is the second special in Phase 10 or 11.
A broken Team Split is one where Vorago is able to throw $auto (Melee or Blue bombs) while charging the $ts.
The best way to reduce the damage from these is to not attack Vorago at all after the Reflect $link ends.
If you get $auto during a broken $ts, simply Pray Deflect Magic $deflectmagic, go to your colour box and eat up. Make sure to go closer to Vorago as soon as the Team Split explodes, otherwise you will drag more Blue bombs $blue into the DPS pile.

.Mauling Phase 10
> __**Mauling Phase 10**__

Mauling Phase 10 is typically the TL5's job, unless the base is meleeing $attack - this is because a melee base would always be in MD and will be able to $maul at the right time. The timing for the $maul is important because it determines what happens at the start of Phase 11.
You must always wait for the special to be released before mauling, otherwise Vorago will start the next phase with it instead of Auto Attacks.

If we take the example of Scopulus week, Vorago's rotation for Phases 10 and 11 are as follows:
• Phase 10: **Purple bomb** $purple release → 5 Attacks $auto → **Reflect** $link (for 3 Attacks) → 3 Attacks $auto → **Team Split** $ts → 3 Attacks $auto
• Phase 11: **Purple bomb** $purple release → 5 Attacks $auto → **Reflect** $link (for 3 Attacks) → 3 Attacks $auto → **Vitalis orb** $vitalis → 3 Attacks $auto

.
If you maul in Phase 10 after 2 Attacks $auto have been released, Vorago has 3 remaining Attacks $auto in his rotation (because in Phase 10, there are a total of 5 $auto before the Reflect $link). At the start of Phase 11, he would perform these 3 $auto before continuing with his rotation, and going into $link.
If you mauled 4 Attacks $auto after $purple release at the start of Phase 10, there would be 1 remaining Attack $auto. This means that Phase 11 would begin with 1 $auto before going into Reflect. This leads to a high chance of killing other people as people attempt to DPS at the start of the phase.
.
If you are unsure of how many Attacks $auto have been fired, it is better to keep Vorago in the $maul spot and $maul when $link starts.

In summary, there are 3 times to $maul that are optimal for the kill, as they maximise the number of Attacks $auto in Phase 11 before the next special:
• #1: When the **first special** begins
• #2 When **Reflect** $link starts
• #3: When the **second special** begins

.
Mauling as soon as Reflect $link starts is good for all rotations, but it is not the best option.
While this can seem complicated at first, mauling at the right time makes the kill easier because you do not have to calculate how many autos $auto remain from the Phase 10 rotation before the next special will occur in Phase 11.

The following chart shows all the possible $maul timings for each rotation, and they assume the $maul occurred as soon as the special started, with no $auto in between the special release and the $maul.

.

.

If you get more than 2 $auto after a Special, go to the next $maul timing as it is best to skip the first timing to optimize the amount of Attacks $auto on the next phase.

__Shield Dome Mauling:__

This is a strategy that allows you to skip the $maul animation in Phase 10. It does not save time but allows everyone to build on the dummy $dummy while Vorago is still talking.
It is done by using Shield Dome $dome before clicking the maul $maul while Vorago is in the $maul spot. do not spam clicking your $dome or the $maul, otherwise it will not work.

.Phase 11 strategies

> __**Phase 11**__

This phase is dealt with in the same way as Phase 10, and following the same descriptions in the Overview above,
The Bomb Tank that used Barricade $cade in Phase 10 should now build to Ultimate $sunshine $swiftness and the other BT should build to Barricade $cade.
Depending on the push, it might be better for BTs to Ultimate and threshold respectively. Only use Barricade $cade for one of the specials in Phase 11.

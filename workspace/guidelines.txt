> __**Guide Writing**__

Before you dive into Rago Hub guide writing, take a couple of minutes to learn the syntax that our <@&812409511179845663> Discord bot uses to parse guides into proper styling.

.
• `.` Write a new message
Due to Discord messages having a limit of `2000` characters, guides need to be sent in multiple messages. To achieve an intentional separation of content into respective messages, this is simply achieved by adding a dot `.` to the start of a line.

.

• `.New Message` Assign a section Identifier to the message
These are known as identifiers, where the identifier is the word after the `.` (in this case, `New Message`).
Section Identifiers should be written-out and capitalized. For example, use `.Phase 3` instead of `.p3`.

__Indices:__

Messages are linked by assigning section identifiers to messages. This identifier is added to the start of a message, appended to the content separator. For example: `.Introduction`.

• `{link:New Message}` Retrieve the message link in the Index
The message ID can be retrieved and linked by the syntax: `{link:identifier}`. These identifiers are case sensitive.
This means that you can't call a section `.test` and then link it as `{link:TEST}`.

.

• `.index` Automatically pin the Index
The bot will automatically pin indices, which can be done by using the `.index` identifier for a section.
The format for this section is: `• $emoji **Headline** {link:Headline}`

.editmessages

> __**Edit Messages**__

This feature comes primarily handy for linking messages that are sent **after** the message you want to link from. Using this syntax will send a temporary placeholder in place of the actual message and edit it once all messages are sent.

• Edit a message by appending a trailing `:edit` notation to the section identifier

.

• The added notation `:edit` is not included in the message reference
• Retrieve the message link with `{link:example}` and **not** with `{link:example:edit}`

• Make use of the `:edit` notation to link messages sent **after** the message containing the message link

.guidestyling

> __**Guide Styling**__

• Avoid using contractions such as "isn't"; use "is not"
• Always leave one preceding and one trailing blank line for titles and images
• Format damage numbers with in-line code blocks, i.e. `10,000`, `4,000`, `10,667`
• Use british over american spelling, i.e. "colour" instead of "color"

__Sections:__

• Section headlines: `> __**Headline**__`, one preceding and one trailing blank line
• Title: `__**Title**__` - this should only be used when you want to split a section into sub-sections; otherwise use sub-headlines
      • For example, to split Phase 3 (your Headlinea) into 6 rotations (Titles) with sub-sections (sub-headlines)
      • Be consistent throughout the section. For example, if you used titles for `**Ceilings**` you must use them for other rotations too
• Sub-headlines: `__Sub-Headline:__`, one preceding and one trailing blank line
• Listing: `• Item of a list`, one blank line before the first and one after the last item
      • Sub-listing: Add 6 spaces before the bullet `      • Item of a sub-list`
• Images should be labeled as list items without colons or other formatting
• Images and GIFs should be uploaded on <https://giphy.com/> or <https://imgur.com/>

__Emojis:__

To parse emojis, add the dollar character `$` preceding emoji keywords. For example, writing `$flush` will be converted to :flushed:. A full list of Emojis can be found in #emojis.
You may also use PvME's builder to convert text into emoji IDs <https://pvme.github.io/rotation-builder/>.

__Testing:__

Head to <#812595920935321632> and use the command `.txtpost` either with an attached text file or with the content added within the Discord message.

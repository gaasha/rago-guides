> __**Zero-Linking Vorago in Phase 5**__

The purpose of this strategy is to finish Vorago off **before** the Reflect $link mechanic occurs.

__Common Terms:__

• 0-Linking
• One-Pushing

__Required Knowledge:__

• Vorago's spawn location until maul $maul requires 8 tiles of push forward
• No push for 3 ticks allows Vorago to trigger an auto attack
• Pushing at TC (reference: #target-cycle) will stall Vorago's special attack, such as Team Split $ts or Purple Bomb $purple

.Overflow
> __**Overflow**__

• One tile push requires 20,000 damage dealt

Imagine using Dragon Breath $dbreath on a target with `100` life points left. The Dragon Breath is not going to deal its full potential (let's assume `10,000`), but will instead deal the exact remaining life points of `100`.
At Vorago Phase 5, 10 and 11, the `20,000` damage act as individual health pools. So once a hit reaches the required cap, its remaining damage is lost entirely, just as if you were killing that `100` HP monster with a `10,000` Dragon Breath.

**Vorago can only move 1 tile per tick**, but other hit splats / damage dealt in the same tick as Vorago being pushed is not lost. It is going to count towards the so-called **Overflow** damage. It is simply added up to the next `20,000` damage needed to push the next tile.

__Example:__

The pool is at `18,000` → you use Snap Shot $snap (hits twice, assume each hit deals `5,000` damage) → the first hit contributes `2,000` to the cap and the remaining `3,000`is lost → the second hit is stored and the overflow pool is now at `5,000`.

.Stalling Vorago
> __**Stalling Vorago**__

• Vorago's auto attack $auto speed in Phase 5 / 10 / 11 is 3 ticks
• Vorago being pushed resets the auto attack timer, causing an additionally stalled tick
• 4 ticks after a push Vorago's next auto attack is triggered
• Without stall, Vorago's auto attacks happen consecutively every 3 ticks

When Vorago gets pushed (both forwards and backwards), the next auto attack $auto will happen 4 ticks after the push. If you push 1 tick before an auto attack would have come, the next auto attack will be delayed by another 3 ticks, generating you 7 ticks of stall before Vorago continues his attack rotation.

**Stalling periodically every 3 ticks** is going to prevent Vorago from releasing any attack, until you have not pushed for 4 ticks or longer. At that point, an auto attack $auto is triggered.

• Dealing the push cap of `20,000` in TC is going to stall any weekly special $ts $purple $vitalis $green
• Weekly special mechanics act as auto attacks $auto
• Weekly specials are integrated in the 3 tick auto attack speed

.Approaching Zero-Links
> __**Approaching Zero-Links**__

• Push on Target Cycle $tc (deal `20,000` damage or more in the very first tick after TC)
• From there on, push once every GCD / 3 ticks (maximizing stall)
• Focus on a consistent start of pushing multiple steps before the spec release

Bare in mind that Zero-Linking is a team effort. Both players have to coordinate their rotations properly in order to achieve consistent and proper Zero-Links.
